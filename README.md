## About
Simple GUI elements library for [Monkey Programming Languages](http://Monkey-x.com).

## Features
- All component can use a customize image or a box
- Button, RadioButton, CheckBox
- Sliders (Horizantal, and vertical)
- Virtual Controller, Multi Game Control handler, Native alerts, Share etc

## Requirements:
- Monkey (an old version 50ish)
- Diddy (Probably needs an old version too.

## ToDo:
- Factor out dependent code.
- Factor out features implemented in my [ioPlus](https://github.com/Alshurafa/ioPlus) library which are most likely implemented now by default in Monkey.
- Bump it up so it support New versions of Monkey
- I use this in my games so I might add more features who knows.

## Why now?
This was developed in 2012 but was never uploaded because it was not an independent module.
Newer versions were lost during a devastating unnatural causes (my laptop crashed :) )
This is the latest version found and will Github to keep track of my progress with it.
